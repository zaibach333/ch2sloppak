# ch2sloppak

Convert a Clone Hero song folder into a [Slopsmith](https://github.com/byrongamatos/slopsmith) `.sloppak` package, or merge CH note data into an existing Rocksmith `.sloppak`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `ffmpeg` on PATH — required for MP3→OGG conversion and multi-stem merging

## Commands

### convert

Convert a CH song folder to a new `.sloppak`:

```bash
python ch2sloppak.py convert <path/to/ch-song-folder>
# → writes "<Artist - Title>.sloppak" next to the song folder

python ch2sloppak.py convert <path/to/ch-song-folder> -o my_song.sloppak

# Old-style invocation still works:
python ch2sloppak.py <path/to/ch-song-folder>
```

### merge

Merge CH note data into an existing Rocksmith `.sloppak`, keeping the RS audio:

```bash
python ch2sloppak.py merge <path/to/ch-song-folder> <path/to/song.sloppak>
# → writes "song+ch.sloppak" next to the RS sloppak

python ch2sloppak.py merge <ch-folder> <rs.sloppak> -o merged.sloppak

# Override auto-detected timing alignment with a manual offset:
python ch2sloppak.py merge <ch-folder> <rs.sloppak> --offset 1234.5

# Fine-tune on top of auto-alignment (negative = shift earlier):
python ch2sloppak.py merge <ch-folder> <rs.sloppak> --nudge -500
```

The merge command auto-aligns CH note timing to the RS audio using
inter-beat-interval cross-correlation of the two beat maps. The verbose output
shows the detected beat shift (K), mean time offset, and IBI residual error — if
the residual is high (> 20 ms), use `--offset` to correct manually.

RS arrangements win on ID collision (e.g. if RS already has `lead`/`bass`,
the CH gamepad versions are skipped). RS audio stems pass through unchanged;
CH audio is discarded. All original RS manifest fields are preserved.

### batch

Convert all CH song folders found recursively under a root directory:

```bash
python ch2sloppak.py batch <path/to/ch-songs-root>
# → converts each CH folder, writes .sloppak next to each source folder

python ch2sloppak.py batch <root> -o <output-dir>
# → all converted and merged outputs go to the specified directory

# Auto-merge with a sloppak library — songs matched by artist+title are
# merged instead of converted standalone:
python ch2sloppak.py batch <root> --library <path/to/sloppaks>
# → merged +ch.sloppak files land next to their originals in the library

python ch2sloppak.py batch <root> --library <path/to/sloppaks> -o <output-dir>
# → merged and converted outputs all go to output-dir

# Overwrite existing output files (default is to skip them):
python ch2sloppak.py batch <root> --library <path/to/sloppaks> -o <output-dir> --force
```

**Default skip behaviour**: if a `.sloppak` output file already exists it is
skipped. Use `--force` to overwrite. Songs skipped because all their CH tracks
are already present in the matched sloppak are also skipped silently.

**Log files** written to the calling directory when applicable:

| File | Written when |
|---|---|
| `mergelog.txt` | At least one merge was performed |
| `skipped.txt` | At least one output file was skipped due to already existing |

Library matching normalises artist and title (lowercase, punctuation stripped)
for comparison. First `.sloppak` match per song wins.

## What gets converted

### Chart formats
| Source | Notes |
|---|---|
| `notes.mid` | Tried first; falls back to `.chart` on parse error |
| `notes.chart` | Used when no `.mid` present |

### Arrangements
| CH track | Arrangement ID | Display name | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `[Expert…Easy]Single` | `lead` | Lead Gamepad | guitar | 5-lane color-fret highway |
| `[Expert…Easy]Bass` | `bass` | Bass Gamepad | guitar | 5-lane color-fret highway |
| `[Expert…Easy]Drums` (4-lane Pro) | `drums` | Drums | drums | drum highway encoding |
| same | `drums_score` | Drums Score | drums_score | treble-clef staff encoding for tab view |
| `PART REAL_KEYS_X/H/M/E` (.mid only) | `keys` | Keys | piano | actual MIDI pitches, piano layout |

The **Type** column matches the `type` field written to `manifest.yaml` — used by
Slopsmith plugins to route each arrangement to the correct view (guitar highway,
drum highway, piano roll, or tab view).

When 2+ difficulties are present a difficulty slider is enabled in Slopsmith
(top-level `notes` = highest difficulty; `phrases` array carries all levels).
Note: the 3D drum highway reads `drum_tab_drums.json` directly and currently
always displays Expert difficulty regardless of the slider position.

In a **merge**, CH guitar/bass tracks are renamed `lead-gamepad` / `bass-gamepad`
to avoid colliding with RS `lead` / `bass` arrangements.

### Audio stems
| Source | Slopsmith output |
|---|---|
| `song.ogg` / `song.mp3` | `stems/full.ogg` |
| `guitar.ogg`, `bass.ogg`, `drums.ogg`, `vocals.ogg`, `keys.ogg` | individual stems |
| `drums_1.ogg` … `drums_4.ogg` | merged into `stems/drums.ogg` |
| `.mp3` / `.opus` variants | converted to OGG via ffmpeg |

### Other
| Source | Slopsmith output |
|---|---|
| `song.ini` + `[Song]` section | `manifest.yaml` |
| `[Events]` lyric events / MIDI VOCALS track | `lyrics.json` |
| `album.png` / `album.jpg` | `cover.<ext>` |
| Drums track (any difficulty) | `drum_tab_drums.json` |

## Drum encoding (4-lane Pro)

Two arrangements are written for every drums track:

**`drums`** — highway encoding: `string = GM_MIDI // 24`, `fret = GM_MIDI % 24`

**`drums_score`** — treble-clef staff encoding for the tab view plugin.
Notes are mapped to standard percussion staff positions with cymbal hits
marked muted (`mt: true`) to render as × noteheads.

| CH note | Flag | Drum part | Staff position |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 / 32 | — | Kick / 2× Kick | between lines 1–2 |
| 1 | — | Snare | between lines 3–4 |
| 2 | cymbal | Hi-Hat | above staff (×) |
| 2 | tom | Yellow Tom | between lines 4–5 |
| 3 | cymbal | Ride | line 5 (×) |
| 3 | tom | Blue Tom | line 4 |
| 4 | cymbal | Crash | ledger line above staff (×) |
| 4 | tom | Floor Tom | between lines 2–3 |

`.chart`: lanes 2/3/4 are toms by default; cymbal flags (66/67/68) mark cymbals.  
`.mid`: lanes 2/3/4 are cymbals by default; tom-marker notes (110/111/112) mark toms.

A `drum_tab_drums.json` file is written for every song with drums and referenced
in the manifest — consumed by the `slopsmith-plugin-drum-highway-3d` plugin.

## Guitar / Bass encoding

CH lanes map to Slopsmith strings and frets to match color-coded highway lanes:

| CH lane | Color | String | Fret |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Green | 0 | 5 |
| 1 | Red | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | Yellow | 2 | 2 |
| 3 | Blue | 3 | 3 |
| 4 | Orange | 4 | 4 |
| 7 | Open | 5 | 1 |

HOPO and tap flags are preserved.

## Pro Keys encoding

`PART REAL_KEYS_X/H/M/E` tracks contain raw MIDI pitches (A0–C8).
Each note is mapped to a string/fret pair using a piano-octave layout
(6 strings × 12 frets, one octave C–B per string, covering display range C2–C7).
The tuning offset compensates for alphaTab's standard guitar +12 display transposition.
Routed to the piano roll via `type: piano` in the manifest.

## Limitations

- No `.chart` support for Pro Keys (`.mid` only)
- No 5-lane drums decoding (Pro drums only)
- No chord-template grouping (simultaneous notes written as individual notes)
- Drum highway difficulty slider shows Expert only (drum_tab format limitation)
